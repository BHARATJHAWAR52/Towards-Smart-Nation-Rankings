# Towards-Smart-Nation-Rankings

This repository contains the code and resources for a framework that evaluates and ranks 157 countries based on their "smartness" using curated World Development Indicators (WDIs). The study aims to identify critical metrics contributing to a nation's smartness while providing actionable insights for policymakers.

## Abstract

This study introduces a framework and taxonomy to evaluate and rank 157 countries as "smart nations" based on curated World Development Indicators (WDIs). By identifying critical metrics that contribute to a nation’s “smartness” and eliminating redundant indicators, we streamline over 1,400 metrics from the World Bank database. Our weighted ranking system positions Germany, Switzerland, and Denmark as top-ranked smart nations, while countries like Burundi, Madagascar, and Congo, Dem. Rep., are ranked lower. India holds the 77th position, providing insights into key areas of potential national improvement. Through comprehensive data preprocessing to address noise and missing values, the framework provides a data-driven, unbiased ranking and serves as an actionable tool for policymakers to enhance their country’s smart nation status.

## Introduction

The concept of a "Smart Country" embodies a nation equipped with integrated digital infrastructure, accessible services, sustainable governance, and responsive public policies. While smart city initiatives focus on localized urban enhancements, this framework addresses national scale assessments across various sectors such as healthcare, infrastructure, education, and digital governance.

This repository aims to bridge the gap in existing research by developing a data-driven model that ranks countries on their smartness, using objective historical data from the World Bank’s WDIs covering nearly 157 countries.

## Features

- Comprehensive evaluation of 157 countries based on 82 selected indicators.
- Data preprocessing techniques to handle missing values and noise.
- A weighted ranking model that incorporates a variety of metrics related to education, health, infrastructure, governance, and more.
- Actionable insights for policymakers to enhance national smartness.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Utilized World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI) dataset.
2. **Indicator Selection**: Narrowed down from 1,486 to 82 key indicators relevant to national smartness.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Employed techniques like interpolation, KNN imputation, and ARIMA forecasting to handle missing values.
4. **Ranking System**: Developed a weighted scoring method to compute a composite smartness score for each country.

## Usage

To run the framework and reproduce the results:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BHARATJHAWAR52/Towards-Smart-Nation-Rankings.git
   cd SmartNationsRanking
